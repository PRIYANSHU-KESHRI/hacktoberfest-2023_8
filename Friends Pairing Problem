Given N friends, each one can remain single or can be paired up with some other friend. Each friend can be paired only once. Find out the total number of ways in which friends can remain single or can be paired up.
Note: Since answer can be very large, return your answer mod 10^9+7.


Example 1:

Input:N = 3
Output: 4
Explanation:
{1}, {2}, {3} : All single
{1}, {2,3} : 2 and 3 paired but 1 is single.
{1,2}, {3} : 1 and 2 are paired but 3 is single.
{1,3}, {2} : 1 and 3 are paired but 2 is single.
Note that {1,2} and {2,1} are considered same.
Example 2: 

Input: N = 2
Output: 2
Explanation:
{1} , {2} : All single.
{1,2} : 1 and 2 are paired.






def countFriendsPairings(N):
    mod = 10**9 + 7
    
    # Initialize the DP array to store the number of ways for each friend
    dp = [0] * (N + 1)
    
    # Base cases
    dp[0] = dp[1] = 1
    
    # Calculate the number of ways using dynamic programming
    for i in range(2, N + 1):
        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % mod
    
    return dp[N]

# Example usage
N = 3
result = countFriendsPairings(N)
print(result)
